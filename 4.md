## Clyde Edwards-Helaire

 Clyde Edwards-Helaire is a young running back that we picked up a few years ago in the draft from LSU. We drafted Clyde to replace our very good running back Kareem Hunt that we traded away. Many fans did not know how well Clyde was going to be but he has helped us win many games.
